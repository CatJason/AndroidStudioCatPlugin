            <![CDATA[
            <p>Android Studio Ladybug Canary 2+ now supports Wear Tile Animation Previews,
            making it easier than ever to inspect and debug your
            <a href="https://d.android.com/training/wearables/tiles/animations">tile animations</a>
            directly within the IDE. This feature builds upon the
            <a href="https://d.android.com/training/wearables/tiles/preview">Wear Tiles Preview</a>
            support introduced in Android Studio Koala.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This enhancement streamlines your Wear Tile development workflow by providing
            a visual and interactive way to fine-tune your tile animations within Android Studio.</p>

            <p>Ladybug Feature Drop deprecates the
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/motion-editor">Motion Editor</a> as
            part of the ongoing transition from XML to
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/compose">Jetpack Compose</a>. Compose offers a more
            modern and efficient approach to building animations, and we encourage developers to start using

            <p>Provide custom prompts for Gemini in Android Studio to generate code suggestions. You
            can ask Gemini to simplify complex code by rewriting it, perform very specific code
            transformations such as "make this code idiomatic," or generate new functions you
            describe. Android Studio then shows you Gemini's code suggestion as a code diff, so that
            you can review and accept only the suggestions you want.

            <p>Android Studio now includes a new sensor panel, which lets you simulate a device
            having or not having specific sensor capabilities, such as a heart rate sensor, as well
            as set specific test values for these sensors. Use this panel to test how your app
            handles devices that have different sensor capabilities. This panel is useful for
            testing health and fitness apps, especially on Wear OS devices.

          <section>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>To implement App Links, developers need to publish a Digital Asset Links JSON
            file on their websites to verify ownership of the domain. When the App Links Assistant
            identifies failed web checks, it now creates a JSON file which can fix those failures.
            This JSON file can be downloaded by the user and subsequently uploaded to the respective
            website to resolve the web check failures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In cases where a JSON file already exists, users have the ability to compare the
            existing and newly-generated JSON files to identify differences.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To open the App Links Assistant navigate to <b>Tools > App Link Assistant</b> from
            the main menu bar.</p>
